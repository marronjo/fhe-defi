# 🔐 FHE-enabled DeFi Research

**Exploring the intersection of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi)**

This repository is dedicated to research and experimentation at the frontier of crypto privacy: applying FHE to DeFi protocols. Our goal is to enable **private, trustless financial interactions**—from encrypted market orders to confidential on-chain computation.

## 🧪 Exploration

- ⚙️ **Private Market Orders**  
  Leveraging FHE to enable encrypted limit and market orders within public AMM protocols (e.g., Uniswap v4).

- 🧠 **Smart Contract Hooks with FHE**  
  Using Uniswap's hook architecture to trigger private logic without leaking sensitive intent or strategy.

- 🛰️ **FHE Coprocessor Integration**  
  Offloading secure computations to an external coprocessor that can operate on encrypted data.

- 📈 **Practical Privacy for Traders**  
  Building systems that respect user privacy *without* breaking composability or permissionless access.
