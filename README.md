## üß™ Abstract

This project explores how **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** can be applied to 
**Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** to enable truly private on-chain interactions.

By integrating FHE with **Uniswap v4‚Äôs hook architecture**, we introduce a system 
where users can submit **encrypted market orders** without revealing intent or strategy.

Hooks trigger private computations within a secure coprocessor (e.g., Fhenix), enabling order execution only when encrypted conditions are met.

This approach preserves **composability** and **permissionless access**, while offering 
**meaningful privacy for traders** in public AMM environments.

## ü¶Ñ High-Level Overview: How Swaps Work & Uniswap v4 Features

At its core, a **swap** is a simple trade between two tokens. In decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, this happens using **automated market makers (AMMs)**, which replace traditional order books with mathematical formulas to determine prices based on token reserves.

### üîÑ Basic Swap Flow

1. A user sends token A to a liquidity pool.
2. The pool returns token B, based on the current exchange rate.
3. The swap affects the pool‚Äôs token ratios, updating prices for the next trade.

### üß± Enter Uniswap v4: Hooks & Custom Logic

Uniswap v4 introduces **hooks**, a powerful new upgrade that allows developers to run custom smart contract logic at specific points in the swap lifecycle:

- `{before,after}Initialize`
- `{before,after}AddLiquidity`
- `{before,after}RemoveLiquidity`
- `{before,after}Swap`
- `{before,after}Donate`

These hooks turn Uniswap into a **programmable liquidity layer**, enabling use cases like:
- On-chain limit orders
- Dynamic fees
- KYC or access control
- Strategy execution
- üïµÔ∏è And in our case: **encrypted, privacy-preserving order flow using FHE**

### v4 Hook Flow Example

This diagram illustrates how Uniswap v4 hooks (`beforeSwap`, `afterSwap`) fit into the swap lifecycle.

## üìö Learnings & Takeaways

This research demonstrates that **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** can meaningfully expand the design space of decentralized finance by enabling **privacy-preserving logic** directly within **Uniswap v4 hooks**.

With a myriad of use cases ‚Äî from market and limit orders to TWAMM, custom AMMs, and encrypted receipts ‚Äî  
FHE allows for **encrypted intent**, **conditional execution**, and **selective disclosure**,  
all without sacrificing composability.

However, key trade-offs emerge:

- FHE systems rely on **off-chain coprocessors**, introducing:
  - Latency
    - trade timing is affected
    - slower UX compared to regular swaps
    - price swings can cause worse execution price for users
  - Liveness requirements
    - coprocessor uptime
    - operation is skipped / lost (never executed)
    - recover previous state after outages
  - Processing Capacity
    - can off-chain services keep up with real-time trading demand
    - FHE operations are **intensive** and performance remains a limiting factor for high-frequency or large-scale order flows.

- User Expsense üí∏
  - **On-chain interactions involving FHE hooks** typically incur higher gas costs due to:
    - Additional logic for encrypted order evaluation
    - Interaction with external coprocessors or encrypted state
    - Complexity of maintaining privacy-preserving conditions inside smart contracts
    - All FHE encrypted numbers are 256 bits, so no storage slot optimization / packing is possible within smart contracts

  - Users may also bear **indirect costs** such as:
    - Fees paid to off-chain relayers or coprocessor operators
    - Delays in order execution due to FHE decryption latency

  - Depending on the chain, these costs may be **significantly amplified on Ethereum mainnet**, but more manageable on **L2s or high-throughput chains**.

  - Designing efficient UX flows (e.g., batching, permits, meta-transactions) will be critical to minimizing user burden and making FHE-enabled DeFi approachable.

- While **on-chain privacy** is improved, **metadata leakage** (e.g. timestamps) remains a challenge.

Hook-based designs offer:
- Tight **integration** with Uniswap pools
- **Reactive, composable** behavior that integrates with the existing swap lifecycle
- But come with higher gas costs and architectural complexity

Off-chain alternatives are:
- **Cheaper and more flexible**
- But sacrifice reactivity, composability and decentralisation

In short, **FHE hooks enable a powerful privacy layer**, but must be applied **carefully** with attention to UX, cost, latency, and trust boundaries.
