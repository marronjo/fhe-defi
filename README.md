## üß™ Abstract

This project explores how **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** can be applied to 
**Decentralized Finance (DeFi)** to enable truly private on-chain interactions.

By integrating FHE with **Uniswap v4‚Äôs hook architecture**, we introduce a system 
where users can submit **encrypted market orders** without revealing intent or strategy.

Hooks trigger private computations within a secure coprocessor (e.g., Fhenix), enabling order execution only when encrypted conditions are met.

This approach preserves **composability** and **permissionless access**, while offering 
**meaningful privacy for traders** in public AMM environments.

## ü¶Ñ High-Level Overview: How Swaps Work & Uniswap v4 Features

At its core, a **swap** is a simple trade between two tokens. In decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, this happens using **automated market makers (AMMs)**, which replace traditional order books with mathematical formulas to determine prices based on token reserves.

### üîÑ Basic Swap Flow

1. A user sends token A to a liquidity pool.
2. The pool returns token B, based on the current exchange rate.
3. The swap affects the pool‚Äôs token ratios, updating prices for the next trade.

### üß± Enter Uniswap v4: Hooks & Custom Logic

Uniswap v4 introduces **hooks**, a powerful new upgrade that allows developers to run custom smart contract logic at specific points in the swap lifecycle:

- `{before,after}Initialize`
- `{before,after}AddLiquidity`
- `{before,after}RemoveLiquidity`
- `{before,after}Swap`
- `{before,after}Donate`

These hooks turn Uniswap into a **programmable liquidity layer**, enabling use cases like:
- On-chain limit orders
- Dynamic fees
- KYC or access control
- Strategy execution
- üïµÔ∏è And in our case: **encrypted, privacy-preserving order flow using FHE**

### üß© Summary of FHE Hooks

| Hook Type         | Description                                                                                   | Key Features                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

### üßë‚Äçüíª User Experience

While FHE-powered privacy introduces important protections, it also presents new UX challenges:

#### ‚è± Latency from Decryption (async tax)
- Encrypted data must be processed by an off-chain FHE coprocessor.
- This adds **noticeable delay** between user intent and trade execution.
- Users may experience a **slower feedback loop**, especially compared to typical instant DeFi swaps.
- FHE operations are computationally intensive and cause delays in otherwise synchronous workflows.

#### üß© Delayed Execution from Bundling
- To preserve privacy and obfuscate order flow, swaps may be **batched or bundled** together.
- This can delay trade execution, particularly in low-volume pools or quiet market conditions.
- **Users may wait longer** for their order to be processed or revealed.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Uncertainty at Execution Time
- Since swap metadata remains encrypted until after settlement (or not revealed at all),  
  users may feel **less clarity** about what is happening during a transaction.
- **UI design must compensate** by surfacing trusted indicators (e.g. "pending decryption", timers, etc.).

#### üîÅ Trade Reversibility and Cancel UX
- Encrypted logic may make it harder to **cancel** or modify an in-flight order.
- Additional design may be needed to allow users to reclaim tokens or cancel swaps before execution triggers.

#### üß† Cognitive Load
- Concepts like delayed reveals, audit-controlled access, and bundled execution may introduce **new mental models** unfamiliar to most DeFi users.
- Intuitive frontends and clear messaging are essential to avoid confusion and build trust.  

**Overall**, while FHE hooks offer groundbreaking privacy, they require **careful UX design** to ensure smooth interaction, responsiveness, clear user feedback, and robust expectations around performance.

## üìö Learnings & Takeaways

This research demonstrates that **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** can meaningfully expand the design space of decentralized finance by enabling **privacy-preserving logic** directly within **Uniswap v4 hooks**.

With a myriad of use cases ‚Äî from market and limit orders to TWAMM, custom AMMs, and encrypted receipts ‚Äî  
FHE allows for **encrypted intent**, **conditional execution**, and **selective disclosure**,  
all without sacrificing composability.

However, key trade-offs emerge:

- FHE systems rely on **off-chain coprocessors**, introducing:
  - Latency
    - trade timing is affected
    - slower UX compared to regular swaps
    - price swings can cause worse execution price for users
  - Liveness requirements
    - coprocessor uptime
    - operation is skipped / lost (never executed)
    - recover previous state after outages
  - Processing Capacity
    - can off-chain services keep up with real-time trading demand
    - FHE operations are **intensive** and performance remains a limiting factor for high-frequency or large-scale order flows.

- User Expsense üí∏
  - **On-chain interactions involving FHE hooks** typically incur higher gas costs due to:
    - Additional logic for encrypted order evaluation
    - Interaction with external coprocessors or encrypted state
    - Complexity of maintaining privacy-preserving conditions inside smart contracts
    - All FHE encrypted numbers are 256 bits, so no storage slot optimization / packing is possible within smart contracts

  - Users may also bear **indirect costs** such as:
    - Fees paid to off-chain relayers or coprocessor operators
    - Delays in order execution due to FHE decryption latency

  - Depending on the chain, these costs may be **significantly amplified on Ethereum mainnet**, but more manageable on **L2s or high-throughput chains**.

  - Designing efficient UX flows (e.g., batching, permits, meta-transactions) will be critical to minimizing user burden and making FHE-enabled DeFi approachable.

- While **on-chain privacy** is improved, **metadata leakage** (e.g. timestamps) remains a challenge.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Hook-Based Designs vs Off-Chain Alternatives

#### üîó Hook-Based Designs

Hook-based systems are implemented directly within the Uniswap v4 protocol using its native hook architecture.

**Benefits:**
- Tight **integration** with Uniswap pools, enabling privacy logic to be executed **in-line with swaps**.
- **Reactive and composable**: Hooks respond immediately to swap events (`beforeSwap`, `afterSwap`), making them ideal for fully on-chain strategies like encrypted AMMs, TWAMM, or access control.
- Preserve decentralization by keeping execution within Ethereum‚Äôs security boundary.

**Drawbacks:**
- Come with **higher gas costs** due to extra logic, state handling, and computational overhead.
- Increased **architectural complexity**‚Äîdevelopers must reason about async decryptions, gas limits, and state syncing within Uniswap‚Äôs execution model.
- Deployment is more constrained: contracts must conform to hook interface standards and interact safely with the PoolManager.

#### üåê Off-Chain Alternatives

Off-chain models shift order handling and encryption/decryption logic to external services or relayers.

**Benefits:**
- **Cheaper execution**: Most of the computation (especially FHE operations) happens off-chain, reducing on-chain gas consumption.
- Greater **flexibility** in system design ‚Äî easier to iterate, upgrade, and experiment without redeploying smart contracts.
- Can support complex logic, batching, or fallback mechanisms not easily implemented in Solidity.

**Drawbacks:**
- Sacrifice **reactivity** ‚Äî orders can't respond instantly to swap events without trusted intermediaries.
- Lose **composability** with Uniswap and other DeFi protocols, as order flow becomes isolated from on-chain logic.
- Introduce **trust assumptions** and reduce decentralization ‚Äî unless mitigated through  
  **cryptoeconomic incentives**, **multi-party computation (MPC)**, or **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)** to enforce correctness and fairness in off-chain execution.

---

Choosing between these models depends on your design goals:

- Use **hooks** when composability, reactivity, and decentralization are priorities.
- Use **off-chain models** for experimental features, reduced costs, or where trust assumptions are acceptable and manageable.
